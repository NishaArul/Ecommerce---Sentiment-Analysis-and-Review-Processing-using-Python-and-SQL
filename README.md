## E-commerce Sentiment Analysis and Review Processing Project
  Exciting News 🚀! I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my E-commerce Sentiment Analysis and Review Processing project using Python and SQL! 📊✨
  I recently participated in a week-long project organized by Hicouncler, a prominent US-based company in the field. 🌐🔍 During this project, I delved into an 
  in-depth analysis of an e-commerce platform using a provided dataset.

### Project Walkthrough Video
I've put together a comprehensive video where I guide you through the entire project, offering insights into the coding process. Make sure to check it out on my YouTube Channel! 🎥🔗 [YouTube Video Link](https://lnkd.in/gDrAgcBC) 

  	  🔍 Level: Intermediate
	  🐍 Technique Used: Python, SQL
	  📚 Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Nltk(sentimentIntensityAnalyzer, polarity_scores, word_tokenize, settings.normalize)
	  🗃️ File Type: CSV

### Project Overview
The objective of this project was to conduct a thorough analysis of an e-commerce platform using a dataset that included crucial information about products, customer reviews, purchase history, seller details, categories, and more. 🛍️

My primary goal was to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, top-performing products, seller effectiveness, customer satisfaction, and overall platform performance through the application of advanced data analysis techniques.

### Project Modules
* Module 1: Data Cleaning - I started by extracting the raw data and performing comprehensive cleaning and transformation using Python.
* Module 2: Sentiment Analysis - Utilizing the NLTK library, I conducted sentiment analysis to gauge the sentiment of customer reviews.
* Module 3: SQL Queries - I established a connection between Hicouncler's user-friendly Sandbox platform and MySQL. This facilitated the smooth loading of refined data into SQL, where I executed a series of query functions to derive data-driven insights.

### Platform Used
I would like to express my gratitude to Hicouncler for providing their user-friendly Sandbox coding platform. This eliminated the need to download separate coding applications and streamlined my coding experience. 🖥️👏
